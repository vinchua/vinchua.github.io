Hi, I'm Vincent. I study Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia. 

I have a background in IT, system administration, and DevOps, having worked at the [Genome Sciences Center](https://www.bcgsc.ca/) on the IT Systems team, and as a DevOps engineer at [FLIR Systems](https://www.flir.ca/iis/machine-vision). I have also worked as a firmware developer at [Arlo Technologies](https://www.arlo.com/en-ca/default.aspx).

I'm interested in DevOps and IT technologies, and am a fan of working on the command line. In my free time, I enjoy distro-hopping, playing the piano, and learning Mandarin. 

Currently, I am looking for full-time DevOps/IT positions beginning May 2021.
