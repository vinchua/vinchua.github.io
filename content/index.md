Hi, I'm Vincent. I study Computer Engineering at UBC. I have a background in IT, system administration, and DevOps, having worked at the Genome Sciences Center on the IT team, and as a DevOps engineer at FLIR Systems.

I'm interested in DevOps and IT technologies, and am a fan of working on the command line. In my free time, I enjoy distro-hopping, playing the piano, and browsing Reddit. 

I have done co-op terms at FLIR Systems and Arlo Technologies, working as a DevOps Engineer and a Firmware Engineer respectively. 

Currently, I am looking for full-time DevOps/IT positions beginning May 2021.
