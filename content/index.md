Hi! I'm Vincent, a 5th year Computer Engineering student studying at the University of British Columbia.

I'm interested in DevOps and IT technologies, and am a fan of working on the command line.

I have done co-op terms at FLIR Systems and Arlo Technologies, working as a DevOps Engineer and a Firmware Engineer respectively. Currently, I am looking for full-time DevOps and IT positions beginning May 2021.
