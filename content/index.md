Hi, I'm Vincent. I'm a DevOps Developer at IBM Canada, on the SaaS team for Cloud Pak for Business Automation. 

I graduated from the University of British Columbia, with a Bachelors in Computer Engineering. 

I've worked at:
- [Genome Sciences Center](https://www.bcgsc.ca/) on the IT Systems team as a co-op
- [FLIR Systems](https://www.flir.ca/iis/machine-vision) as a DevOps Engineer co-op
- [Arlo Technologies](https://www.arlo.com/en-ca/default.aspx) as a Firmware developer co-op

I'm interested in DevOps and IT technologies and enjoy working on the command line. In my free time, I enjoy distro-hopping on Linux (currently using Endeavour OS), playing the piano, and learning Mandarin.
